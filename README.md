# Capstone EDA & Modeling


This project provides a comprehensive workflow for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and modeling on financial investment data. The notebook is designed to support a variety of analytical and machine learning tasks relevant to investment and customer analytics.

- **A. Risk Tolerance Prediction (Classification)**
- **B. Customer Segmentation (Clustering with KMeans)**
- **C. Investment Product Recommendation (Multi-class Classification)**
- **D. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)**
- **E. Fairness & Bias Analysis (Race / Gender / City Tier)**
- **F. Sentiment & Satisfaction Analysis (Comment â†’ sentiment; link to satisfaction & risk)**
- **G. Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and Export**


## Data Sources
- `Combined_Investment_Data_100k_full.csv`: Main dataset ([Kaggle Source](https://www.kaggle.com/code/emremsr/finance-data/input))
- Enriched columns: Education Level, Annual Income, Employment Status, Risk Tolerance, Race, City Tier, Investment Avenue, Comment


## Main Files
- `Capstone_EDA_Modeling.ipynb`: Main notebook for EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and analysis
- `cleaned_with_features.csv`: Output dataset with engineered features (clusters, anomaly flag, sentiment)
- `SampleGenerator.py`: Script for generating or augmenting sample data


## Workflow Overview
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
	- Handles missing values, normalizes column names, and caps outliers
	- Renames key columns for consistency
2. **Feature Engineering**
	- Adds sentiment scores, clusters, and anomaly flags
3. **Modeling**
	- Implements classification, clustering, and anomaly detection using scikit-learn
4. **Fairness & Bias Analysis**
	- Evaluates model performance across sensitive groups (gender, race, city tier)
5. **Visualization**
	- Plots distributions, cluster projections, and feature importances
6. **Export**
	- Saves the cleaned and feature-enriched dataset for downstream tasks

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open `Capstone_EDA_Modeling.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run cells sequentially to perform EDA, feature engineering, and modeling.
3. The cleaned dataset will be saved as `cleaned_with_features.csv`.


## Notes
- The notebook is modular; you can run only the sections you need.
- Sentiment analysis is basic and can be improved with NLP libraries.
- Fairness analysis is included for key sensitive attributes.
- Column renaming is performed for clarity and consistency.
